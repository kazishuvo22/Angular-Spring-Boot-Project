# Angular-Spring-Boot-Project
New Life Hospital is one of the leading hospitals in your residence. Recently, the hospital authorities craved for a Hospital Management System to optimize and digitize all the processes within their hospital, which will help to improve customer service, reduce process costs, streamline the search of medical records, bills, patients and doctors.
Fortunately, your company gets the opportunity to digitize their system. Your project manager, Mr. Xahid is assigned to develop the software for New Life Hospital. Luckily, Mr. Xahid has expertise in Hospital Management System and you donâ€™t have to worry about Project Management (Requirements, Functionalities, Architectures etc).


Mr. Xahid specializes in Agile Software Development and wants to develop a highly secured, scalable, flexible, loosely coupled system with greater maintainability. After going through all the requirements, functionalities and resources currently available in the company, he decides to develop a Web-based In-house Software with Multi-tier Modular Architecture.
	 
    Giving heed to all of this considerations, he decides to develop the system with the following technologies:
    Presentation Tier: Angular(Javascript), HTML, CSS
    Application Tier: Java Spring Boot
    Data tier: MongoDB

Mr. Xahid has assigned you to develop the e-Prescription Module. This module registers patient details based on general and demographic information. Patients are allocated a Unique Health Identification Number (UHID) and generate a prescription template for the designated doctor using patients information. Salient features of this module include:
Detailed information of patients (Patient registration)
Mandatory fields for crucial patient information as per JCI Standards
Advanced multi-criteria search for registered patients
Alerts in place to prevent erroneous data entry

In your one month of internship, you are going to implement all of these features using the technologies stated above. VIS will give you a development environment, track your activities and help you develop the e-Prescription Module throughout your internship.
We have splitted up your job into the following tasks for facilitating you to implement the required features of e-Prescription Module and you are going to complete each of the tasks sequentially to develop this module.
